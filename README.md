# Code-Quiz

## Description

This code quiz opens on the start screen; displaying the start button and a link to the scoreboard. Once the start button is clicked, the quiz and timer begin. If the user selects the correct answer, they will be given 10 points. If the user selects the incorrect answer, the timer will deduct 10 seconds from the timer. Once a choice is selected, the next question appears. The quiz ends when there are no more questions or no more time on the clock. User should be able to submit their initials to log the remaining time and score in the scoreboard. 

<!-- (Unfortunately, I was unable to get the information to log in the scoreboard.) -->
